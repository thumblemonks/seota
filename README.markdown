# [Seota](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/seota)

I think agencies are making too much money off of this SEO hype thing and I would like to help by making this tool free as in free for anyone to use. What does it do? Hopefully most of the basic or not so basic checklisty type things any good internet marketing "guru" would tell you to do and charge 1200USD for. It won't make you breakfast in the morning and it won't tell you why you're content sucks, but it should give you some statistics about your site as it relates to content.

In fact, I think this tool is useful as a part of a larger "smoke test" that you run before putting your latest masterpiece in production. That's what I'm going to do with it anyways.

There's a lot more to come, like: a usage thingie and site you can go to in order to use the tool without running it yourself. In good time things will wait.
