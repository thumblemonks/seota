# Per site

* Look for sitemap in robots.txt before falling back to sitemap.xml, then sitemap.txt
* Google search on "site:<hostname>" for user
* (maybe) Look for pages not listed in the sitemap

# Per page

Either by walking the sitemap or by crawling pages

* Check for links with no `title` attribute
* Check for images with no `alt` attribute
* (maybe) Check for broken links
